# City_Project

## Project Overview
The project's objective is to design and implement a web presentation of an imaginary presentation for a selected town/city.  
I did choose "Croissy-Beaubourg" city because I have seen a lot of problems in their website. Plus, this city is very small while being near bigger city. 

## Requirements 
- Landing page - initial page to attract the user (tourist, etc.) - composed of photos
- News, events, calendar, etc.
- History of the city/town, popular people born there, etc.
- Selected sightseeing (buildings, nature, industry, attractions, etc.)
- Services (accommodation, restaurants, sections for locals, etc.)
- Contact information, including addresses, institutions (opening hours, etc.)
